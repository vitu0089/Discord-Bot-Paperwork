## Storage Location
All data is stored on the server, and is protected by the security of the company "Plox Host".

## Right of removal
If you wish for your data of a player or a server to be deleted, this must be done in person. A feature for this will be introduced in the future, but for now, contacting me on the support server is the only way to remove your data.
